# Albatross Knowledge Base

## Overview

**Albatross** (`https://albatross.myblueraven.com`) is SunPower/Blue Raven Solar's project management and interconnection operations platform. This skill provides comprehensive reference documentation for read-only exploration and data extraction.

## When to Use

- Understanding Albatross structure and layout
- Planning browser automation workflows
- Looking up URL patterns and navigation
- Understanding project data architecture
- Identifying export and reporting capabilities

## Platform Architecture

### Authentication
- **Method**: Email/Password
- **Environment Variables**: `ALBATROSS_USERNAME`, `ALBATROSS_PASSWORD`
- **Architecture**: Single Page Application (SPA)
- **Behavior**: URL changes don't trigger full page reloads; data loads asynchronously

## Direct URL Patterns

### Project Access
```
Project Status:     /project/{PROJECT_ID}/status
Project Details:    /project/{PROJECT_ID}/details
Process Step:       /project/{PROJECT_ID}/processStep/{STEP_ID}
```

### Work Queue Access
```
Queue Dashboard:    /workQueue
Specific Queue:     /workQueue/{QUEUE_ID}?smartlistId={SMARTLIST_ID}
```

### Database Access
```
Utility List:       /database/utility
Utility Detail:     /database/utility/{UTILITY_ID}/details
```

### Administrative
```
Company Dashboard:  /companyDashboard
Users:              /users
Organizations:      /orgs
Smartlists:         /smartlist/mine (or /public)

2. Data loads asynchronously after navigation
3. Table population takes 2-3 seconds
4. Notes lazy-load on scroll
5. Export downloads immediately (no dialog)

### Recommended Wait Times

| Action | Wait |
|--------|------|
| After navigating to queue | 2-3 seconds |
| After navigating to project | 2-3 seconds |
| After scrolling notes | 1 second |
| Before clicking export | 2-3 seconds after load |

## Critical Patterns to Detect

| Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "DO NOT FOLLOW UP" | Project on hold | Skip automation |
| "DO NOT TOUCH" | Absolute blocker | **Never automate** |
| "Legal Involvement" | Legal review | Requires approval |
| "SALES ENABLEMENT TAKING OVER" | Cancellation in progress | Monitor only |
| "LEGAL DO NOT TOUCH" | Legal hold | No action |
