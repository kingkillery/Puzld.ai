# Settings and config locations

Key points from Factory CLI settings docs:

- Use /settings in the CLI to view and update settings.
- Local settings are stored in ~/.factory/settings.json.
- BYOK custom models live under customModels in settings.json.
- Some older guidance references ~/.factory/config.json with custom_models.
