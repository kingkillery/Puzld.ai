# Custom droids (subagents)

Key points from the custom droids docs:

- Personal droids live in ~/.factory/droids.
- Project droids live in <repo>/.factory/droids.
- Factory watches those directories and loads .md files with YAML frontmatter.
- Droids are enabled by default and can be toggled in /settings.
- Droids can be used as Task tool subagents (subagent_type).
- Keep only droid definition files in the droids directories.
