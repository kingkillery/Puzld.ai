# Local Plugins Marketplace

This is a local marketplace for custom Claude Code plugins developed by prest.

## Available Plugins

### ralph
Autonomous AI coding loop that ships features while you sleep. Ralph picks stories from a PRD, implements them, runs checks, commits, and repeats until done.

### ralph-loop
Continuous self-referential AI loops for interactive iterative development, implementing the Ralph Wiggum technique. Run Claude in a while-true loop with the same prompt until task completion.

### campaign-agents
Hierarchical agent system for long-running autonomous coding campaigns. Uses Claude Opus 4.5 for planning and pk-puzldai/droid with minimax-m2.1 and GLM-4.7 for task execution.

## Installation

These plugins are automatically available since this marketplace is registered locally.

To use these plugins, simply reference them in your Claude Code sessions:
- `/ralph` - Start the ralph autonomous coding loop
- `/ralph-loop` - Start continuous Ralph loops
- `/campaign` - Use campaign-agents commands (init, status, pause, resume)
