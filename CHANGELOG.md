# Changelog

All notable changes to PuzldAI will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.2.64] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Token counting for Claude, Gemini, and Codex adapters (footer now shows usage)
  - Claude: Uses `--output-format json` for token extraction
  - Gemini: Uses `-o json` for token extraction
  - Codex: Uses `--json` for JSONL token extraction
- Agent selection panel via `/agent` command (without args)
  - Navigate with arrow keys, Enter to select, Esc to cancel
  - Shows agent status (ready/offline) and current selection

### Fixed
- `/agent X` notification now displays properly (timed 2s notification instead of flickering)

---

## [0.2.63] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Interactive mode for pipeline/workflow execution (Phase 6)
  - TUI: Enable via `/settings` toggle, shows step confirmation dialog
  - CLI: `--interactive` flag for `puzld run --pipeline/--template` and `puzld autopilot --execute`
  - Options: [Y] Yes, [A] Yes All, [S] Skip, [E] Edit prompt, [X] Abort
- StepConfirmation component with edit-in-place prompt support

### Fixed
- Workflow edit mode now preserves existing steps - exiting without changes no longer shows error

---

## [0.2.62] - 2025-12-10

### Added
- Update check on TUI startup - prompts when newer version available
- Boxed prompt with [U] Update / [S] Skip options

---

## [0.2.51] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- Fresh session on startup instead of loading latest (use `/resume` to continue previous)
- First-launch hint shows "Use /resume to continue a previous session" (auto-dismisses after 4s)

---

## [0.2.5] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- "Messages hidden" hint in compare/collaboration modes (shows count + Esc to return)

  - Grey lines (0.8 width)
  - `[Single]` chip tag
  - Mode indicator (`auto` or `selected`)
  - Execution time at footer with green status dot

### Fixed
- **5 race conditions identified and fixed:**
  - Stale session capture - now re-fetches session after async operations to prevent cross-agent contamination
  - Compare result lookup - uses Map for O(1) access instead of array find
  - Pipeline memory - `Promise.allSettled` preserves partial results (summary OR keyPoints) on failure
  - Scaffolding - `Promise.allSettled` preserves successful chunk summaries if some fail
  - Executor (2 places) - `Promise.allSettled` preserves batch results when individual steps fail
- Autocomplete dropdown now visible in compare/collaboration modes
- Keyboard handler for autocomplete navigation works in all modes (was disabled in compare/collaboration)

- Compression ratio metrics

#### Context Window Manager (`src/context/window.ts`)
