## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added - Phase 1-4 Complete

#### Token Management Layer (`src/context/tokens.ts`)
- Token estimation using ~4 chars/token standard
- Per-adapter limits (Claude 100k, Gemini 128k, Codex 32k, Ollama 8k)
- Reserve tokens for response budget
- Smart truncation at paragraph/sentence boundaries
- Text chunking for scaffolding support
- Context usage tracking with percentage

#### Summarization Layer (`src/context/summarizer.ts`)
- Zero-cost compression using local Ollama
- Code block preservation (extract → summarize → restore)
- Graceful fallback to truncation if Ollama unavailable
- Skip-if-short optimization
- Key points extraction utility
- Compression ratio metrics

#### Context Window Manager (`src/context/window.ts`)
- Agent-specific context rules (Claude verbose, Ollama minimal)
- Priority-based compression (code priority 8, summaries priority 3)
- Dynamic Ollama model limits (llama3.1=128k, mixtral=32k)
- Structured context tags (`<code_context>`, `<previous_context>`)
- User override via config `maxTokens`

#### Pipeline Memory (`src/executor/memory.ts`)
- Auto-summarized step outputs
- Token-safe variable injection
- Key point extraction for tight budgets
- Memory stats tracking across steps
- Budget-aware output formatting

#### Semantic Relevance Scoring (`src/context/relevance.ts`)
- Embedding-based relevance via Ollama (nomic-embed-text)
- Keyword fallback using Jaccard similarity
- Recency scoring with linear decay
- Configurable weights (embedding vs keyword vs recency)
- `filterByRelevance()` and `getTopRelevant()` utilities

#### Session Manager (`src/memory/sessions.ts`)
- Persistent chat history to `~/.puzldai/sessions/`
- Auto-summarization when token limit reached
- Per-agent session isolation
- Token tracking per session
- Compression ratio stats

#### CLI Session Commands (`src/cli/commands/session.ts`)
- `puzld session list [agent]` — List all sessions
- `puzld session new [agent]` — Create a new session
- `puzld session info <id>` — View session details
- `puzld session delete <id>` — Remove a session
- `puzld session clear <id>` — Clear history, keep session

#### TUI Session Management (`src/tui/components/SessionsManager.tsx`)
- `/session` — Create new session directly
- `/resume` — Interactive picker with arrow navigation
- Menu: All Sessions / Current Agent Sessions
- Session detail view with stats
- Resume, Clear History, Delete actions
- Confirm dialogs default to "No" for safety

#### TUI Settings Panel (`src/tui/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`)
- `/settings` — Open tabbed settings panel
- 6 tabs: Status, Session, Config, Correct, Debate, Consensus
- Tab to cycle, ↑↓ navigate, ←→ change values, Enter/Space toggle

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration (`src/executor/plan-builders.ts`)
- **Cross-Agent Correction** — One agent produces, another reviews, optional fix step
  - CLI: `puzld correct "task" --producer claude --reviewer gemini [--fix]`
  - TUI: `/correct <producer> <reviewer> <task>`
- **Multi-Agent Debate** — Agents argue positions across configurable rounds
  - CLI: `puzld debate "topic" -a claude,gemini [-r 3] [-m ollama]`
  - TUI: `/debate <agents> <topic>`
- **Consensus Building** — Agents propose, vote, and synthesize best solution
  - CLI: `puzld consensus "task" -a claude,gemini,ollama [-r 2] [-s claude]`
  - TUI: `/consensus <agents> <task>`

#### CLI Collaboration Commands (`src/cli/commands/collaboration.ts`)
- `puzld correct` — Cross-agent correction with --producer, --reviewer, --fix
- `puzld debate` — Multi-agent debate with -a agents, -r rounds, -m moderator
- `puzld consensus` — Consensus building with -a agents, -r rounds, -s synthesizer

#### TUI Collaboration Settings
- **Correct tab** — Toggle fix after review
- **Debate tab** — Set rounds (1-5), moderator agent
- **Consensus tab** — Set voting rounds (1-5), synthesizer agent
