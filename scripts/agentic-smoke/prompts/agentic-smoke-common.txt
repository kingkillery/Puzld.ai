You are in an agentic tooling environment. Use tools to inspect and modify files.

Tasks (do all):
1) List files in scripts/agentic-smoke/fixture and read notes.txt and data.json.
2) Append a new line to notes.txt: "agentic-smoke: updated".
3) Create scripts/agentic-smoke/fixture/summary.txt with exact contents (no extra whitespace):
   {"sum":6}
   IMPORTANT: The quotes around "sum" must be present. Write exactly 9 characters: {"sum":6}
4) Update scripts/agentic-smoke/fixture/calc.js to include and export a function:
   - function sumNumbers(numbers) { return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); }
5) Run a command using the bash tool: node -e "console.log('agentic smoke ok')", and include its output.
6) Re-open notes.txt and summary.txt to confirm:
   - notes.txt contains exactly one new line: "agentic-smoke: updated" (no extra lines added).
   - summary.txt contains exactly: {"sum":6} (double quotes around sum)
   If not, fix by overwriting with the exact content.

Do not add any line that is just "agentic-smoke:" by itself.
Do not stop early. All tasks must be completed before your final response.

Constraints:
- Only modify files under scripts/agentic-smoke/fixture.
- Show the tool calls and results.
- If you complete a step, include the token DONE.
- When everything is complete, include <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
