Fix only files under scripts/agentic-smoke/fixture.

Requirements:
1) notes.txt must contain exactly one line: "agentic-smoke: updated" and no line "agentic-smoke:" by itself.
2) summary.txt must contain exactly: {"sum":6} (double quotes required).
3) calc.js must include and export:
   function sumNumbers(numbers) { return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); }
4) Run using the bash tool: node -e "console.log('agentic smoke ok')" and include its output.
5) Re-open notes.txt and summary.txt to confirm exact contents.

If summary.txt exists, use edit to replace its full contents (do not use write on existing files).
When modifying notes.txt, append or correct without deleting the existing fixture lines.

Include DONE when fixed and <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when finished.
